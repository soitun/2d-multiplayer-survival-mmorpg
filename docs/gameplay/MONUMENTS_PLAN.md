Purpose: rare fuel items, solvents, flammable crafting components. Maybe a fire hazard zone.
Footprint: medium.

9. Weather Station Z-4

Purpose: seasonal contracts for calibration, weather prediction buffs, or securing atmospheric data for ALK.
Footprint: small.

10. Collapsed Mine / Tuff Quarry

Purpose: controlled ore source, mini mobs, shard-infused minerals. Make it a loopable mid-game route.
Footprint: medium interior.

11. Algae Research Barge (beached)

Small, stranded research platform partly rusted into the sand.
Purpose: biofuel materials, scientific scrap, water purification components.
Footprint: small.

12. Windswept Graveyard of Driftwood

A natural collection zone where storms push in wreckage.
Purpose: renewable low-tier salvage, low-threat PvP hotspot.
Footprint: long narrow strip.

13. Shard Bloom Site

• one is a failed hydroponic wing
• one is a flooded node filled with kelp

Purpose: rotating contracts, seasonal variations, and emergent tasks tied to the kernel.
