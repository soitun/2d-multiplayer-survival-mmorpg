# Memory Grid Tech Tree System
*"Navigate the cognitive pathways of advanced technology"*

## System Overview

The **Memory Grid** functions like Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid - players start at the center and can move in any direction through the main tech tree, then branch into faction-specific paths. Players can unlock all main grid nodes but faction specialization requires commitment.

### Core Mechanics:
- **Main Grid:** Shared technology accessible to all players
- **Faction Branches:** Specialized paths with higher costs and exclusive items
- **Faction Lock:** Optional commitment system with reset cost
- **Memory Shard Economy:** Based on 1,500+ shards/hour farming rate

---

## Memory Shard Economy

### Current Drop Rates:
- **Barrels:** 8-15 shards per barrel (98% drop rate)
- **Barrel Spawns:** 48-96 barrels across map, 10-minute respawn
- **Memory Shard Plants:** ~150 plants, 1-3 shards each, 30-45min respawn
- **Realistic Farming Rate:** 1,500+ shards/hour for dedicated players

### Cost Scaling Philosophy:
- **Main Grid:** Affordable for experimentation
- **Faction Branches:** Expensive to encourage specialization
- **Full Completion:** Impossible in single wipe, promotes choice

## System Mechanics

### Faction Lock System:
- **Optional Commitment:** Players can choose to lock into one faction
- **Cost Reduction:** 50% discount on all nodes in chosen faction
- **Lock Cost:** 10,000 shards (one-time payment)
- **Reset Cost:** 25,000 shards (wipes all faction progress)

### Ultimate Abilities:
- **Single Active:** Only one ultimate can be equipped at a time
- **Swap Cost:** 1,000 shards to change active ultimate
- **Cooldown:** All ultimates have 60-second cooldown

### Passive Stacking:
- **Cross-Faction Caps:** Maximum +10% per stat type across all branches
- **Strategic Choice:** Players must choose which passives to prioritize

---

## Progression Economics

### Time Investment (1,500 shards/hour farming):
- **Main Grid Completion:** 50-65 hours
- **Single Faction Branch:** 60 hours (30 hours if faction locked)
- **Two Faction Branches:** 180+ hours
- **Full Tech Tree:** 500+ hours (impossible in typical wipe cycle)

### Typical Player Paths:
1. **Essential Main Grid** (30,000 shards) - Basic guns, armor, vehicles
2. **One Specialized Branch** (45,000 shards if locked) - Faction mastery
3. **Selective High-Tier** (15,000 shards) - Cherry-pick Tier 5-6 items

### Wipe Cycle Realism:
- **Casual Player:** Main grid + partial faction specialization
- **Dedicated Player:** Main grid + one complete faction + dabbling
- **Hardcore Groups:** Coordinate specializations for team synergy

This system encourages meaningful choices, promotes faction identity, and ensures that the tech tree remains engaging throughout multiple wipe cycles without being completable by solo players.
