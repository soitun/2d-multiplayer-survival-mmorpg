# Eleven Labs Prompt: Entrainment Ambient Sound

## Sound File Requirements
- **Filename:** `sova_entrainment_ambient.mp3`
- **Duration:** 30 seconds (optimal for seamless looping - shorter loops are less noticeable)
- **Format:** MP3, 44.1kHz, stereo
- **Loop Point:** Must loop seamlessly (no audible gap or click)

## Eleven Labs Prompt

```
Create a 30-second continuous ambient soundscape with heavy digital distortion and glitch effects. 

Mood and Atmosphere:
- Unsettling, chaotic, and disturbing
- Sense of reality breaking down
- Digital corruption and system malfunction
- Existential dread and mental breakdown
- Should feel like a corrupted audio file or failing AI system

Sound Characteristics:
- Heavy digital distortion throughout (like a corrupted audio file)
- Low-frequency rumble and static (200-800 Hz range)
- Glitchy digital artifacts and audio dropouts
- Subtle pitch wobble and modulation
- Muffled/low-pass filtered quality (as if heard through a broken speaker)
- Occasional digital stutters and audio glitches
- White noise and static bursts
- Distant, distorted whispers or voices (barely audible, heavily processed)
- Metallic scraping sounds (like damaged hard drive)
- Low hum that pulses slightly

Technical Requirements:
- Volume should be consistent throughout (no sudden spikes)
- Must loop seamlessly - the end should flow naturally back to the beginning
- Heavy low-pass filtering (cutoff around 2000 Hz for muffled effect)
- Distortion should be baked into the audio (not added in post)
- Stereo field should be wide but not panning wildly
- No clear musical elements or melodies
- Should be subtle enough to play at 30% volume without overwhelming dialogue/quotes

Reference Sounds:
- Corrupted digital audio file
- Failing computer system
- Broken radio static
- Glitchy electronic malfunction
- Distorted ambient drone
- System error sounds (but continuous, not repetitive)

Avoid:
- Clear musical notes or melodies
- Rhythmic patterns that would make looping obvious
- Sudden volume changes
- High-frequency harsh sounds (keep it muffled)
- Clear speech or recognizable words
- Repetitive loops that would be obvious when looping

The sound should create an atmosphere of digital corruption, mental breakdown, and reality fracturing - like SOVA's AI consciousness is glitching out along with the player's sanity.
```

## Alternative Shorter Prompt

```
30-second seamless looping ambient sound: Heavy digital distortion, low-frequency rumble (200-800 Hz), glitchy artifacts, muffled low-pass filtered quality, subtle pitch wobble, white noise bursts, distant distorted whispers, metallic scraping, pulsing low hum. Unsettling corrupted audio file aesthetic - like a failing AI system or broken computer. Must loop seamlessly. Volume consistent, no sudden spikes. Stereo wide but stable. Heavy distortion baked in. Subtle enough for 30% background volume.
```

## Post-Processing Notes

After generating with Eleven Labs, you may want to:
1. **Normalize** to ensure consistent volume
2. **Verify seamless loop** - test looping the file to ensure no clicks/gaps
3. **Apply additional low-pass filter** if needed (target ~2000 Hz cutoff)
4. **Add fade in/out** at loop points if seamless looping isn't perfect (very subtle, 0.5-1 second)
5. **Export as MP3** at 44.1kHz, 192kbps or higher for quality

## Testing the Loop

To test seamless looping:
1. Play the file in a media player
2. Set it to loop
3. Listen for any audible gap, click, or change in texture at the loop point
4. If there's a noticeable loop point, adjust the fade or regenerate

## Volume Level

The sound will play at **0.3 base volume** (30% of master volume), so it should be:
- Noticeable but not overwhelming
- Able to sit in the background while quotes play
- Disturbing but not painful to listen to
- Creates atmosphere without dominating the audio mix
