 * Arctic Walrus Behavior - Defensive Beach Guardian with Breeding System    *
 *                                                                            *
 * Walruses are massive, EXTREMELY slow defensive animals that patrol        *
 * beaches. They only attack when provoked (attacked first), never flee      *
 * from threats, and are extremely persistent once engaged.                  *
 * Strong but very slow with equal movement and sprint speeds.               *
 *                                                                            *
 * UNIQUE TRAIT: Walruses are CURIOUS about ALL light sources:               *
 *   - Burning campfires                                                      *
 *   - Lit lanterns (placed in the world)                                    *
 *   - Players carrying lit torches                                          *
 * Instead of fearing fire like other animals, they will investigate and     *
 * slowly circle around warm glowing lights, watching with fascination       *
 * while keeping a safe distance.                                            *
 *                                                                            *
 * BREEDING SYSTEM (passive farming feature):                                 *
 *   - Sex: Male/Female assigned at birth/spawn                              *
 *   - Age Stages: Pup (8 days) → Juvenile (14 days) → Adult                 *
 *   - Rut Cycle: Every 30 game days (15 real hours), lasts 5 days           *
 *   - Mating: Male + Female proximity for 3 nights during rut               *
 *   - Pregnancy: 12-15 game days (6-7.5 real hours)                         *
 *   - Birth Limit: 1 pup per female per rut cycle                           *
 *   - Population Control: Soft cap per chunk with penalties                  *
 *                                                                            *
 * TIMING (1 game day = 30 real minutes):                                    *
 *   - Full growth to adult: ~22 game days = 11 real hours                   *
 *   - Pregnancy: ~13.5 game days = 6.75 real hours                          *
 *   - Rut cycle: 30 days = 15 real hours                                    *
 *                                                                            *
