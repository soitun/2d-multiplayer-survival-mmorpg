    <p>Earlier this month we decided to share Broth & Bullets with the r/aigamedev community on Reddit. The post covered our full stack — React 19 + Vite 6 + TypeScript on the frontend, SpacetimeDB for authoritative multiplayer, Rust compiled to WebAssembly for game logic — plus spatial subscriptions, procedural world generation, dynamic weather, the SOVA voice assistant, and our AI-generated art pipeline. We kept it technical and honest about costs, architecture, and what's still in progress.</p>

    <p>The response was better than we expected.</p>

    <h2>📢 The Reddit Post</h2>

    <p>You can read the full post here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/1r1sf20/spacetimedb_aigenerated_assets_opensource_2d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cta-link">SpacetimeDB + AI-Generated Assets: Open-Source 2D Survival Game on r/aigamedev</a></p>

    <p>We laid out the architecture, spatial chunking, world generation, weather systems, AI usage for art and recipes, auth setup, and cost breakdown. No fluff — just the kind of detail that other developers actually care about.</p>

    <h2>💬 The Feedback</h2>

    <p>The comments rolled in fast. "Well done! Loads here — very cool." "Holy hell that's impressive. Good job!" "Super dope! The roll movement & animation was a nice touch!" "Love it!" "Honestly? You had me at Broth and Bullets."</p>

    <p>Beyond the kind words, we got real technical questions: How did we generate the tiles with converging borders? How long did it take start to finish? What about self-hosting to cut costs? How do the animations work? People compared it to Realm of the Mad God and asked how to get started with a similar project. One person even pointed out that the Discord link on GitHub wasn't working — we fixed that.</p>

    <p>That kind of engagement is exactly what we wanted. Developers helping developers, and a community that actually reads the architecture before asking "how do I run this?"</p>

    <h2>📈 The Repository Is Growing</h2>

    <p>Broth & Bullets is fully open source under Apache 2.0. The codebase, architecture, and systems are free to use, fork, and learn from. If you want to dive in, clone the repo, follow the README, and start building:</p>

    <p>The repository keeps growing — new features, optimizations, and documentation land regularly. We're committed to keeping it a solid reference for anyone building multiplayer survival games with SpacetimeDB, AI-generated assets, or both.</p>
