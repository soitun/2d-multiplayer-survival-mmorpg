    <h2>What Are Top-Down Survival Games?</h2>

    <p>Top-down survival games present gameplay from an overhead or isometric perspective, giving players a bird's-eye view of their character and surroundings. This perspective offers several advantages:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Better situational awareness</strong> - See threats from all directions</li>
      <li><strong>Tactical planning</strong> - Easier to plan base layouts and routes</li>
      <li><strong>Reduced motion sickness</strong> - Stable camera reduces nausea</li>
      <li><strong>Classic gameplay feel</strong> - Nostalgic appeal for longtime gamers</li>
      <li><strong>Performance friendly</strong> - Often runs better on older hardware</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The top-down perspective has a long history in gaming, from early Zelda games to modern survival titles. It's particularly well-suited for survival games where awareness and planning are crucial.</p>
