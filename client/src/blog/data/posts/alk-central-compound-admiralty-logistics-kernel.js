    <p>When you wash up on the remote Aleutian island after breaching the Ice Storm, you assume it's uninhabited — volcanic ridges, fumaroles, old Federation ruins, and the wreckage of whatever outposts once existed here. Then you discover the Compound.</p>

    <p>It isn't a settlement. It isn't a bunker. It isn't a military base. It's an automated logistics nexus built decades ago by the long-defunct Admiralty Directorate — and it's still running.</p>

    <h2>🏛️ The Admiralty Logistics Kernel: A Ghost in the Machine</h2>

    <p>The Admiralty Directorate was established before the Ice Wall went up — Gred's initial attempt to map out the Bering Sea and beyond. Some say old crews never made it back. The Directorate once managed fisheries, research posts, and drone networks across the islands, but their infrastructure collapsed during the long Freeze. The Compound's geothermal core survived, a ghost of Gred's early ambitions.</p>

    <p>Inside it still runs a degraded automation brain known as the <strong>Admiralty Logistics Kernel (ALK)</strong> — a blind, procedural system that believes it is maintaining an island network that no longer exists. There are no Admiralty officials left. No Directorate. No governance. ALK treats any living human as a valid contractor because the civilizational context it was built for is gone.</p>

    <p>By fulfilling its phantom maintenance tasks — "Buoy Resupply," "Station Repair," "Composite Allocation" — survivors slowly become the de facto operators of a system they didn't design and don't fully understand. They aren't rebuilding the old world. They're inhabiting the empty space it left behind.</p>

    <h2>📍 The Central Compound: What Can You Do There?</h2>

    <p>The ALK Central Compound sits at the heart of the island's paved asphalt zone, surrounded by dirt roads and monument structures. It's the main hub — and the only place where certain operations are possible.</p>

    <h3>📦 Deliver Contracts (No Fee)</h3>

    <p>When you bring raw materials into ALK's intake scanner — ore, lumber, fish, herbs, anything — ALK matches what you delivered to one of its phantom maintenance tasks and pays you in Memory Shards. The Central Compound charges <strong>zero delivery fee</strong>, unlike the four substations at the island's corners, which deduct a percentage of your reward.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seasonal Harvest:</strong> Plant-based items that change with the seasons — foraged plants, mushrooms, berries</li>
      <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Stone, ore, wood, fiber, sulfur — always available</li>
      <li><strong>Arms, Armor, Tools, Provisions:</strong> Crafted items that ALK accepts for shard rewards</li>
      <li><strong>Daily Bonus Contracts:</strong> Time-limited, high-reward contracts — <em>Central Compound only</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🛒 Buy Orders (Central Compound Exclusive)</h3>

    <p>Wealthy survivors can spend Memory Shards to purchase materials directly from ALK. Buy Orders are reverse contracts — you pay a premium (typically ~2x the sell price) for convenience. This creates a shard sink: players with excess shards can convert them into needed materials without gathering or crafting. <strong>Available only at the Central Compound.</strong></p>

    <h3>🏛️ Create and Manage Matronages</h3>

    <p>Matronages are player-formed teams that pool work order rewards. To create one, use a <strong>Matron's Mark</strong> — a ceremonial token — while at the Central ALK Compound. The token is consumed upon use. The founder becomes the Pra Matron, with the power to invite players, promote members, rename the matronage, and remove members.</p>

    <p>Pooled rewards are distributed equally every hour (in-game day) to members' owed balances. <strong>Withdraw your owed shards at the Central ALK Compound</strong> — your balance persists even after leaving the matronage. Use <code>/t</code> or <code>/team</code> to chat privately with matronage members.</p>

    <h3>🛡️ Safe Zone</h3>

    <p>The Central Compound (and all ALK stations) are safe zones. Your insanity meter pauses when you're inside — critical if you're carrying 200+ Memory Shards and at risk of neural interference. The compound's larger radius (8.75x the standard interaction area) makes it a natural gathering point and sanctuary.</p>

    <h2>💎 Memory Shards: What Are They Really?</h2>

    <p>Shards are not magical. They're compressed ML-weight bundles — portable fragments of pre-collapse machine-learning substrate. The Directorate used them as general-purpose computation tokens. Your personal ocular AI, SOVA, wasn't built for them. It comes from Gred. But SOVA can ingest shards because the underlying substrate is universal.</p>

    <p>When SOVA scans a shard, it repurposes the embedded weight patterns to: expand inference layers, unlock dormant routines, improve survival heuristics, generate new crafting schemas, and enhance environmental prediction overlays. The shard is just the raw material. SOVA is the interpreter.</p>

    <p>This creates the survival loop: <strong>Island materials → ALK tasks → shard payout → SOVA upgrades → improved capability → deeper exploitation of the island.</strong></p>

    <h2>🗺️ The Full ALK Network</h2>

    <p>The Central Compound (station_id 0) is the main hub. Four substations occupy the corners of the island's road network. All accept deliveries for most contracts, but:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bonus contracts</strong> and <strong>Buy Orders</strong> are Central Compound only</li>
      <li><strong>Substations</strong> charge a delivery fee on rewards</li>
      <li><strong>Matronage creation</strong> and <strong>shard withdrawal</strong> require the Central Compound</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As more survivors learn how ALK behaves, old radio towers and drop-off stations can be coaxed online with fuel or repairs. When activated, they accept remote deliveries, dispatch outdated courier drones, and integrate more nodes into ALK's decaying network. None of this was planned. The Compound works because nobody shut it off.</p>

    <h2>🎮 Practical Tips for Operatives</h2>

    <p>If you're new to the island, here's what to prioritize:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Visit the Central Compound early</strong> — Check the ALK tab in your Interface Panel (G key) for available work orders. Accept contracts that match your gathering goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Save bonus contracts for the Central Compound</strong> — They pay more and have no substation fee.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage shard carry weight</strong> — Carrying 200+ shards causes gradual insanity (purple visual effect). Deposit at base or spend on upgrades before venturing out.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider a Matronage</strong> — If you play with others, pooling rewards and withdrawing at the compound creates a shared economy.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Buy Orders strategically</strong> — When you're short on a specific material and rich in shards, the compound's buy orders can save time.</li>
    </ol>
