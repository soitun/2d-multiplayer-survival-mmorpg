      <li><strong>Peaceful atmospheres</strong> - Calming music, beautiful environments, optional combat</li>
      <li><strong>Creative freedom</strong> - Focus on building, farming, and crafting at your own pace</li>
      <li><strong>No toxic PvP</strong> - Either PvE-only or cooperative multiplayer</li>
      <li><strong>Progression without pressure</strong> - No time limits or competitive rankings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The cozy survival genre has exploded in popularity as players seek alternatives to stressful games like Rust, ARK, and DayZ. These games prove that survival mechanics can be engaging without being punishing.</p>

    <h2>Cozy Survival Games vs Hardcore Survival Games</h2>

    <p>The main difference between cozy and hardcore survival games is stress level and player agency:</p>

    <p><strong>Cozy survival games</strong> let you set your own pace, experiment freely, and enjoy the journey without fear of losing progress. They're designed for relaxation and creativity.</p>

    <p><strong>Hardcore survival games</strong> (like Rust, ARK, DayZ) create tension through scarcity, permanent loss, and competitive multiplayer. They're designed for adrenaline and competition.</p>

    <p>Neither approach is "better" - they serve different player needs. Many players enjoy both depending on their mood. Some games (like Broth & Bullets, Valheim, and Grounded) offer difficulty modes that let you choose your experience.</p>
