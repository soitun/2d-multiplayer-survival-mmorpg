    <p>It's only been a week since our last update, but the pace of development has been relentless. What started as "let's add a few more animals" turned into a fundamental shift in how the world feels. The tundra is alive now - caribou herds migrate and breed, salmon sharks patrol the deep waters, and the alpine regions finally have the predators they deserve.</p>

    <p>The short version? <strong>The ecosystem is real.</strong> Animals breed, produce resources, and create a living food chain. Combined with traditional Aleutian food preparation methods and new monuments to explore, Broth & Bullets is starting to feel like a place you could actually survive in - not just a game you play.</p>

    <h2>🦌 Animal Husbandry: Breeding, Milking, and Sustainable Survival</h2>

    <p>This is the big one. We've implemented a complete animal husbandry system that fundamentally changes how you approach long-term survival.</p>

    <h3>Breeding System</h3>
    <p>Caribou and walrus now have full breeding cycles. Animals track age, pregnancy status, and breeding readiness. During rut season, males become more aggressive and females can become pregnant. After gestation, new calves are born into the world.</p>

    <p>This isn't just cosmetic - it's a complete population simulation. Overhunt an area and you'll see the consequences. Build a sustainable hunting practice and the herds will replenish themselves.</p>

    <h3>Milking System</h3>
    <p>Female caribou and walruses can now be milked for resources. Approach a nursing female, interact, and collect milk as a renewable food source. This opens up entirely new survival strategies - instead of killing every animal you see, you can maintain a productive relationship with local wildlife.</p>

    <h3>Dairy Products</h3>
    <p>With milk comes dairy. We've added cheese, yogurt, and various milk-based consumables. These provide different nutritional benefits and open up new cooking recipes in the Field Cauldron and Cooking Station.</p>

    <h2>🦈 New Predators: Salmon Sharks and Polar Bears</h2>

    <p>The world just got more dangerous - and more interesting.</p>

    <h3>Salmon Shark</h3>
    <p>The deep waters now have teeth. Salmon sharks patrol the offshore areas, creating real risk for players who venture too far from shore. They're aggressive, fast, and require the new <strong>Tidebreaker Blade</strong> to harvest effectively.</p>

    <p>Killing a salmon shark yields Shark Fin - a valuable crafting material - and other underwater resources. This creates a high-risk, high-reward loop for players willing to brave the deep.</p>

    <h3>Jellyfish</h3>
    <p>Jellyfish now drift through coastal waters. They're passive but touching one delivers an electric shock. Harvest them for Jellyfish Stinger, which can be crafted into the <strong>Jellyfish Compress</strong> - a new healing item that combines the sting's properties with medicinal effects.</p>

    <h3>Polar Bear</h3>
    <p>The alpine regions finally have their apex predator. Polar bears roam the high-altitude areas, creating genuine threat for players exploring mountain monuments. They're rare but deadly - exactly what the alpine needed.</p>

    <h3>Snowy Owl & Arctic Hare</h3>
    <p>Not everything in the alpine wants to kill you. Snowy owls hunt from above while arctic hares provide a skittish food source. These additions round out the alpine ecosystem, making it feel like a real biome rather than just "cold forest."</p>

    <h2>🌾 Traditional Aleut Food Systems</h2>

    <p>We've been researching traditional Aleutian food preparation methods, and they're now in the game.</p>

    <h3>Pulverization & Flour</h3>
    <p>Traditional Aleut peoples made flour from a variety of sources that most survival games ignore. We've implemented a pulverization system that lets you grind:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Kamchatka Lily Bulb</strong> - A starchy root that makes excellent flour</li>
      <li><strong>Silverweed Root</strong> - Sweet and nutritious when ground</li>
      <li><strong>Bistort Bulbils</strong> - Small but protein-rich</li>
      <li><strong>Angelica Seeds</strong> - Aromatic flour with unique properties</li>
      <li><strong>Beach Lyme Grass Seeds</strong> - Coastal grain substitute</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn't just flavor - it's survival strategy. Different flour sources grow in different biomes, so knowing your local plants becomes genuinely important.</p>

    <h2>🏔️ New Monuments</h2>

    <p>Exploration just got more rewarding.</p>

    <h3>Hot Springs</h3>
    <p>Natural hot springs now appear as proper monuments with associated structures. They offer warmth, cooking opportunities, and a moment of peace in a harsh world. We've also added dedicated music for hot spring areas.</p>

    <h3>Wolf Den (Tundra)</h3>
    <p>Wolf dens now spawn in the tundra with associated wolf packs. These are smaller monuments - not marked on the main map - but they're visible on the minimap and create natural danger zones. Clear out a den if you dare.</p>

    <h3>Weather Station & Research Drone (In Development)</h3>
    <p>We've laid the groundwork for two monuments we're genuinely excited about: the Abandoned Weather Station and the Crashed Research Drone. Right now they're placeholder structures, but we have some unique ideas for these that we haven't seen in other survival games. We're keeping the details close to the chest for now - but when these are fully realized, they'll offer gameplay experiences that go beyond "loot and leave."</p>

    <h2>⚔️ Combat & Items</h2>

    <h3>Med Kit</h3>
    <p>A proper military-grade first aid kit. Med Kits are rare spawns in military rations and barrel loot, providing substantial healing when you need it most.</p>

    <h3>Tidebreaker Blade</h3>
    <p>Designed for underwater combat, the Tidebreaker Blade is essential for harvesting salmon sharks and jellyfish. It's the first harvesting tool specifically designed for aquatic encounters.</p>

    <h3>Crossbow Rework</h3>
    <p>Crossbows now require manual reload - right-click to load a bolt before firing. This makes them more tactical weapons: devastating first shots, but vulnerable during reload. The bow remains faster but weaker.</p>

    <h3>Fire Propagation</h3>
    <p>Fire patches now spread realistically. They'll damage planted crops, propagate to nearby wooden structures, and create real consequences for careless fire arrow use. Heavy rain suppresses spread, creating weather-dependent tactical decisions.</p>

    <h2>🛒 ALK Buy Orders</h2>

    <p>The ALK (Automated Logistics Kernel) system now includes Buy Orders. In addition to selling items to ALK for Memory Shards, you can now purchase materials directly. This creates a complete trading economy where shards have real utility beyond just blueprint unlocks.</p>

    <h2>🎨 Visual & Performance</h2>

    <p>We've done extensive optimization work this week:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shore wave rendering</strong> - Rewritten for better performance with array reuse and direct key lookups</li>
      <li><strong>Grass rendering</strong> - Object pooling and pre-allocated arrays reduce garbage collection pressure</li>
      <li><strong>Movement input</strong> - Reduced input lag through ref-based immediate reading</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud & stone rendering</strong> - Pre-computed constants and caching</li>
      <li><strong>New animated sprites</strong> - Wolverine, caribou, fox, tern, tundra wolf, and walrus all have new animated spritesheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📜 License Change</h2>

    <p>We've transitioned from MIT to Apache 2.0 licensing. This provides better patent protection while maintaining our commitment to open development. The codebase remains fully available for learning and reference.</p>

    <h2>🔜 Coming Next</h2>

    <p>The foundation is solid. Here's what's on the immediate horizon:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>More Alpine Content</strong> - The weather station is just the beginning. More high-altitude monuments and challenges are coming.</li>
      <li><strong>Ranged NPC Attacks</strong> - Apparitions that fire back when you use ranged weapons. The nights are about to get harder.</li>
      <li><strong>Bear Traps</strong> - Ground traps for hostile NPCs, animals, and PvP-enabled players.</li>
      <li><strong>Expanded Husbandry</strong> - Chicken coops and more domestic animal options.</li>
      <li><strong>Underwater Lab</strong> - The main lake monument is in development. What secrets does it hold?</li>
    </ul>
