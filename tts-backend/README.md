# Kokoro TTS Backend Service

Python FastAPI service for text-to-speech synthesis using Kokoro-82M model.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 - 3.12** (Python 3.13 is not yet supported by kokoro package)
- **espeak-ng** system dependency (for phoneme conversion)

### Check Your Python Version

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
python --version

# Should show Python 3.10.x, 3.11.x, or 3.12.x
# If you have Python 3.13, you'll need to install Python 3.12 instead
```

If you have Python 3.13, you can:
1. **Install Python 3.12** alongside Python 3.13
2. **Use pyenv** (Windows) or **pyenv-win** to manage multiple Python versions
3. **Create virtual environment with Python 3.12:**
   ```powershell
   # If Python 3.12 is installed as python3.12 or py -3.12
   py -3.12 -m venv venv
   # or
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   ```

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# If you get an execution policy error, run this first:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. System Dependencies

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install espeak-ng  # Ubuntu/Debian
# or
brew install espeak-ng  # macOS
```

**Windows:**
- Download espeak-ng from: https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases
- Add to PATH or install via chocolatey: `choco install espeak-ng`

### 3. Run the Service

```bash
python app.py
```

Or with uvicorn directly:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

## Production Deployment (Railway)

### Step 1: Deploy as a New Service

1. In Railway Dashboard, click **"New"** → **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
2. Select your repository
3. After deployment, click on the service and go to **Settings**
4. Set **Root Directory** to: `tts-backend`
5. Railway will auto-detect the Dockerfile and rebuild

### Step 2: Generate Public Domain

1. Go to **Settings** → **Networking** → **Public Networking**
2. Click **"Generate Domain"**
3. Note the URL (e.g., `https://your-service.up.railway.app`)

### Step 3: Configure CORS (Important!)

Before deploying, update `allow_origins` in `app.py` to include your production domain:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://www.yourdomain.com",
        "https://yourdomain.com",
        "http://localhost:5173",  # Keep for local dev
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### Step 4: Configure Client Environment Variables

Set in your **client** deployment (Railway/Vercel):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `VITE_KOKORO_BASE_URL` | `https://your-tts-service.up.railway.app` |
| `VITE_TTS_PROVIDER` | `kokoro` |

**⚠️ Include `https://` prefix!**

### Step 5: Prevent Cold Starts (Recommended)

Railway may "sleep" the service after inactivity, causing 30-90 second delays on first request.

**Solution: Set up free monitoring with UptimeRobot:**

1. Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/) (free)
2. Create account and add monitor:
   - **Monitor Type:** HTTP(s)
   - **URL:** `https://your-tts-service.up.railway.app/health`
   - **Interval:** 5 minutes
3. This keeps the service warm by pinging it regularly

## Resource Requirements

⚠️ **Important:** Kokoro TTS requires:
- **Memory:** At least 1GB RAM (2GB recommended)
- **CPU:** Model inference is CPU-bound
- **Disk:** ~500MB for model weights (downloaded on first run)

Railway's free tier may not have sufficient resources. Consider:
- Using a paid Railway plan ($5/month Developer tier minimum)
- Or keeping the service warm with external monitoring

---

## API Endpoints

### POST /synthesize
Synthesize speech from text.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "text": "Hello, this is a test.",
  "voice": "af_heart",
  "lang_code": "a"
}
```

**Response:**
- WAV audio file (24kHz sample rate)
- Content-Type: `audio/wav`

### GET /voices
List available voices.

### GET /health
Health check endpoint. Returns `{"status": "healthy"}`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8001` | Server port (Railway auto-sets this) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cold Start Issues
- First request loads the model into memory (can take 30-90 seconds on Railway)
- Set up UptimeRobot to keep service warm
- The client plays `sova_thinking.mp3` while waiting

### CORS Errors
- Ensure your production domain is in `allow_origins` in `app.py`
- Include `https://` prefix in all URLs
- Redeploy after CORS changes

### 405 Method Not Allowed
- Service may not be fully initialized
- Wait for logs to show "Application startup complete"
- Check the URL is correct

### Memory Issues on Railway
- Check Railway logs for OOM (Out of Memory) errors
- Consider upgrading to Developer tier ($5/month)
